# Data-Analysis
Here we've created 2 Data Analytics projects. Python libraries Like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib were used to understand the 
existing data from a CSV file sourced online
 
# 1. Netflix Data Analysis 
The Netflix Data analysis project has checked the existing CSV data to analyze the preferences of users by asking certain questions 
and displaying the data in terms of colorful charts.

# 2. Super Market Sales
The SuperMarketSales Analysis similarly answers different questions by checking the existing data to understand the performance of the
super market. This data in the form of graphs and charts can be used to understand the company better and improve the statistics in 
the future sales.
